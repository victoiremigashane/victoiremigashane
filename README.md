Hello, my name is Migashane. I am studying data science at Galvanized.

My main areas of interest are data science, Machine Learning, and artificial intelligence. 

My current skill set includes languages such as Python, Java, and frameworks such as Pandas and SQL.

I do this because I want to help businesses show off their full potential to customers through data solutions, whether it's a database, a robot, or something else. Also, I adore the process of Data manipulation and the limitless possibilities of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, which allow transportation from a simple idea to a valuable product beneficial to all.

In terms of core skills, I've realized that communication is a major necessity in this field. As a result, I've become very serious about resolving any flaws observed by me and a wide scope of individuals to improve my communication ability. And to do so, I invest in my attitude and tone by reading books and engaging in activities that force me out of my comfort.

In addition to my communication skills, I am a team player with strong problem-solving abilities. And my history of self-discipline has been demonstrated by many exemplary individuals, and my unwavering commitment to my values has been instrumental in the development of my skills.
